# Common Network Optimization Algorithms

Network optimization employs various algorithms to address different aspects of network performance. Here are some common algorithms used in network optimization:

## Load Balancing Algorithms

Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple paths or devices to prevent congestion and optimize resource utilization.

## Bandwidth Management Algorithms

Bandwidth management algorithms prioritize and allocate network bandwidth based on traffic characteristics, ensuring fair distribution and efficient usage.

## Routing Optimization Algorithms

Routing optimization algorithms determine the most efficient paths for data transmission, considering factors such as network topology, link capacity, and traffic conditions.

## Traffic Control Algorithms

Traffic control algorithms regulate and control the flow of network traffic to prevent congestion, prioritize critical traffic, and optimize overall network performance.

For detailed explanations and code examples of these algorithms, refer to the respective sections in this tutorial.
